### Hi there 👋

I am a three-time graduate of Western Governors University and hold a B.S. in Computer Science, an MBA, and an M.S. in Cybersecurity. I also hold a B.A. in Spanish from California State University, Chico and a diploma from The Potomac School in McLean, VA. Addiionally, I have completed coursework towards an MCS (Master of Computer Science) at Arizona State University.

I enjoy learning and exploring new technologies and am self-taught in many things. I am interested in fields related to software engineering, cybersecurity, data science, artificial intelligence, video games, general app development, and relevant studies, such as quantum computing.

Within my personal projects, some of which I publish, I have experience with numerous technologies and tech stacks, ranging from full-stack web development to game development to technology innovation such as designing new programming languages. For these roles I have generally labelled myself as a Software Engineer to encompass everyhing technical related. For client work, I have been a Scrum Master, Chatbot Engineer, and Senior Web Developer and worked with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and WordPress. I designed the chatbot absolutely from scratch with no helper libraries using a wholly heuristic approach to recognize words and phrases as they related to the applications, and so did not implement any kind of tokenizing.

Outside of academics, I am a member of the Order of the Sword & Shield (Omicron Sigma Sigma - ΟΣΣ) from the Western Governors University chapter and a member of Phi Sigma Pi - ΦΣΠ from the Arizona State University Online chapter. I am also a member of Western Governors University's Cyber Security Club (now as an alumnus) and various technology and business clubs at Arizona State University, where I occasionally attend online events.

Among my various other awards I am CompTIA Project+ certified (does not expire) and achieved certification from EC-Council as a Certified Ethical Hacker (C|EH, valid 2022 - 2025).

I am looking for experience and free to move and relocate within the United States.
